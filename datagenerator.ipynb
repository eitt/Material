    "## Manufacturing Process Description\n",
    "---\n",
    "By Leonardo Talero\n",
    "\n",
    "Our manufacturing plant operates on an automated production line overseen by skilled engineers. Materials are selected based on the product requirement, which then undergoes various processing stages, including shaping, assembling, and quality control. Each product's details, like its weight, production cost, sale price, and other relevant metrics, are captured in real-time and logged into our system. \n",
    "\n",
    "We use different machinery for varied tasks, and they are operated in shifts to ensure 24/7 production. Every item manufactured is assigned a unique product code, batch number, and undergoes strict quality control to ascertain its defect rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is an in-depth explanation of each column in our DataFrame:\n",
